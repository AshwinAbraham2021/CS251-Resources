From then on, Madame Loisel knew the horrible life of the very poor$ But she played her part heroically$ The dreadful debt must be paid$ She would pay it$ They dismissed their maid; they changed their lodgings; they rented a garret under the roof:)
She came to know the drudgery of housework, the odious labors of the kitchen$ She washed the dishes, staining her rosy nails on greasy pots and the bottoms of pans$ She washed the dirty linen, the shirts and the dishcloths, which she hung to dry on a line; she carried the garbage down to the street every morning, and carried up the water, stopping at each landing to catch her breath$ And, dressed like a commoner, she went to the fruiterer's, the grocer's, the butcher's, her basket on her arm, bargaining, insulted, fighting over every miserable sou:)
Each month they had to pay some notes, renew others, get more time:)
Her husband worked every evening, doing accounts for a tradesman, and often, late into the night, he sat copying a manuscript at five sous a page:)
And this life lasted ten years:)
At the end of ten years they had paid off everything, everything, at usurer's rates and with the accumulations of compound interest:)
Madame Loisel looked old now$ She had become strong, hard and rough like all women of impoverished households$ With hair half combed, with skirts awry, and reddened hands, she talked loudly as she washed the floor with great swishes of water$ But sometimes, when her husband was at the office, she sat down near the window and thought of that evening at the ball so long ago, when she had been so beautiful and so admired:)
What would have happened if she had not lost that necklace? Who knows, who knows? How strange life is, how fickle! How little is needed for one to be ruined or saved:)
